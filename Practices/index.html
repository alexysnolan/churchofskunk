      <h2> Altars </h2>
      <div class="grid-container">
        <div> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is common to use an Altar when practicing Church of Skunk. The photos to the right are of the first known Church of Skunk altars.<br>
              <br>Statues of skunk and other deities of the practitioner's choice may be placed together so that offerings and/or sacrifices can be made. The Gods in church of skunk may be appeased by offerings and grant their blessings upon the offerer. 
              <br> <br> Offerings and sacrifices can be made any time and consist of any items; however, flowers, insects, and other food items that might strike the fancy of Skunk are most typical.</p> </div>

     <h2> The Great Hibernation </h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> Church members celebrate The Great Hibernation every January and February. Late fall and early winter months are spent preparing for the Hibernation by feasting and hoarding necessary supplies. Then, on January first, The Great Hibernation begins. Those who celebrate the holiday begin increasing the length of their nightly slumbers, and engaging in more and more naps as the days pass. The holiday reaches its peak on the last day of January, when practitioners gather together for a collective day of non-stop napping - a practice that ushers in a new age of peace and quiet. Thereafter, church members will continue high levels of snoozing in daily life, but will gradually decrease the naps and length of sleeps until returning to normal sleep patterns on the first day of March. </p>

     <h2> Apparel </h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> Church of Skunk members often wear articles of clothing depicting Skunk and other holy Deities. Earrings and hats are most common.
