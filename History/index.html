      <p> On a mild September evening, Skunk was recognized as a deity for the first time by Jonny Lukins and Lex Nolan. The two were separated geographically (Jonny in Columbus, Ohio and Lex in Baldwin, Michigan), but they were spiritually entwined as they shared in the experience of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7tOllzEIb0Eaej-wj-KqGSerKXb1t-Dy">skunk seconds</a> on Berd's YouTube channel. The two felt Skunk's blessings upon them as they were brought to tears by the beauty of SKunk's holy form. </p>

      <p>In a moment of divine inspiration, Jonny was compelled to create artistic depictions of skunk and the ancient Goddess Macha combined as one. In the present day, the Goddess has chosen the form of a fluffy very fluffy extremely fluffly black cat. The Original Artworks by Jonny can be viewed below.</p>

  <p> With the creation of these holy images, the divinity of Skunk could no longer be denied. Thusly, on the Twelfth of September, in the year Two thousand and Twenty Four, the Church of Skunk was born. Jonny and Lex began to wish Skunk's holy blessings upon each other, as well as their friends, colleagues, and family members. </p>
  <p> Interest in the church began to grow; the first official convert was only 9 days later on September 21st. Since then, membership has continued to grow slowly but steadily and additional Deities have been added to the Church pantheon. </p>
