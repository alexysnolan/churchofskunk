      <h1> <strong> Our Enemies </strong> </h1>
      <h2> Corn Lord </h2>
        <p> Corn lord is an entity composed of corn kernals, cobs, husks, and stalks - he is enemy #1 in Church of Skunk. Corn lord wants nothing more than to destroy skunk and all that skunk stands for.

      <br>
      <h1> <strong> Neutral Entities </strong> </h1>
      <h2> Yodeling Pickle </h2>
        <p> The yodeling pickle is technically a neutral entity, though it is currently under investigation for demonic behavior. It may grant you good fortune, but it gets a sick pleasure out of chaos and will usually only do so if your goals align with the pickles underlying motivations. It is known for supporting right wing fanatics and will not hesitate to curse you if you offend it. Do not let your guard down around the pickle; it will always sing its haunting melody when least expected. </p>

It is common for members of Church of Skunk to feel a stronger connection with certain deities than others, and it is encouraged that members primarily worship the deities that serve them best. Deities can be
