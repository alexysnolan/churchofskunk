      <p> <em> Although it goes without saying that Skunk is the most powerful and all-encompassing deity in Church of Skunk, there are other important deities that may have more power than skunk when it comes to specific areas. It is common for members of Church of Skunk to feel a stronger connection with certain deities than others, and it is encouraged that members primarily worship the deities that serve them best. Deities can be  
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfsDRfyBIzU86reP4CoLUwrKKQf8oFb-uvYBqgk0LtLGtGFpA/viewform?usp=header"> submitted</a> 
to the Church Council for review, and they may be added to the official Church pantheon if approved. </em> </p>
    <h2> Skunk </h2>
      <P> Skunk is the highest deity in Church of Skunk. SkunK is the God of Everything except construction, corn, and some cheeses. Skunk began as one singular skunk, and decided to split into two skunks, which then continued to divide to this day, populating the earth in many forms. Skunk appreciates insect sacrifices at the altar. </p>
    <h2> Macha and Badb of The Morrigan </h2>
      <p> Macha and Badb are deities known as The Morrigan. She is a powerful shapeshifting goddess of olde, originating in Irish mythology. The Morrigan holds the most power when it comes to war and death. The Morrigan is also associated with fate and sovereignty. Within Church of Skunk, she is most powerful in her fluffy black cat form (Macha) and in her crow/raven forms (Badb). Macha appreciates moth and spider sacrifices at her altar. </p>
    <h2> Hazelnut </h2>
      <p> Hazelnut is associated with widsom and prophetic knowledge. Hazel twigs hold a lot of power and were once used to channel magick. Although magick is not a strong force in the modern world, some Church of Skunk members use it in their religious practice and hope that there will be a day when magick returns to the world more strongly. </p>
    <h2> The Sun </h2>
      <p> As one of the oldest deities, the sun has been worshipped in many cultures and religions throughout human history. It brings light, life, and warmth into the world. According to some, the sun is also associated with justice, and will dole out gorgeous sunny days or blistering sweaty days impartially, depending on what is rightfully called for. </p>
    <h2> Dolly Parton </h2>
      <p> Dolly Parton is the goddess of Kindness, Music, and Charity. She is also associated with having a good time, particularly in a hill people kind of way. She especially appreciates dried flower sacrifices at the altar.</p>

      <h1> <strong> Our Enemies </strong> </h1>
      <h2> Corn Lord </h2>
        <p> Corn lord is an entity composed of corn kernals, cobs, husks, and stalks - he is enemy #1 in Church of Skunk. Corn lord wants nothing more than to destroy skunk and all that skunk stands for. He is devious and clever, and will whisper his sacriligous plans in the ears of the unsuspecting - compelling them to do his bidding. </p>
      <h2> Cone Lord </h2>
        <p> As a representative of road construction, Cone Lord is the second most hated enemy in Church of Skunk. </p>
      <h2> The Mumkin Man </h2>
        <p> The Mumkin Man is a cursed entity with unknown motivations and intentions. His appearance strikes terror into the soul of anyone who is unfortunate enough to be in his presence. </p> 
      <h1> <strong> Neutral Entities </strong> </h1>
      <h2> Yodeling Pickle </h2>
        <p> The yodeling pickle is technically a neutral entity, though it is currently under investigation for demonic behavior. It may grant you good fortune, but it gets a sick pleasure out of chaos and will usually only do so if your goals align with the pickles underlying motivations. It is known for supporting right wing fanatics and will not hesitate to curse you if you offend it. Do not let your guard down around the pickle; it will always sing its haunting melody when least expected. </p>
